<h3>A savory treat for <em>any</em> time of day</h3>
<br>
<br>
I got this baked French toast recipe from my sister in law. She and my brother had it at their gift opening after the wedding. I make it any time we have people staying with us, and it is always a hit. You may sprinkle the top with pecans if you wish.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>French bread:</strong> This recipe starts a loaf of French bread, cut into diagonal pieces. </li>
    <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> The base of the French toast custard is eight large eggs.</li>
    <li><strong>Milk</strong> and <strong>half-and-half:</strong> Youâ€™ll need milk and half-and-half to complete the custard. </li>
    <li><strong>Vanilla</strong> and <strong>cinnamon:</strong> Take the warm and cozy flavor up a notch with vanilla extract and ground cinnamon. </li>
    <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Butter lends richness and flavor.</li>
